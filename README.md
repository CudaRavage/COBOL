I want to learn COBOL so I can grow in my career (accountant), and I miss programming.
I opened ChatGPT and said "Teach me COBOL." and it is going so very well so far. Anything that does not make sense it can explain on the spot, and it gives me positive encouragement when I solve problems. It explains in great detail how and why segments of code work. This is pretty cool!
